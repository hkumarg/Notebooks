<h2> Practice session on Jupyter Notebook with Python techniques for Data science and ML</h2>

<h1>Installation and Startup</h1>

<p>The easiest way to install Jupyter is by running pip install jupyter, though if you use a packaged python distribution such as Anaconda, you may already have it installed. Be sure to activate your Python environment first. Let’s dive in.</p>
<p>When running Jupyter locally, you’ll connect to a locally running webserver through your browser, typically on port 8888. Start your notebook by running jupyter notebook in your working directory. Typically Jupyter will open automatically once it starts up, but if not, point your browser over to localhost:8888
